INSTRUCTIONS and ASSUMPTIONS


Assumptions:
 - This is a combined design of RESTful API-Centric design and MVC design.
   
 - Valid API calls are as follow: 
      // example: http://localhost/api/user/1233 "an integer"
      // example: http://localhost/api/user/new
      // example: http://localhost/api/user/ score      
      // example: http://localhost/api/user/edit
      // example: http://localhost/api/user/get? key="total_players"
      // example: http://localhost/api/user/get? key="total_players_today"
      // example: http://localhost/api/user/get? key="top_ten_players_by_score"

 - document root is /var/www/htdocs/

 - There is no view layer here! Only data layer and core of application!

   
Instructions:      
 - Database can be created at mysql command line by running:
   mysql> source users_schema.sql;
   This will create some views too to improve performance.    
   
 - To initialize database and tables with some data, in shell command run: 
   shell> php addUsers.php
    
 - For API Centric approach, follow this instruction:
   - create a folder with that name 'user' under document_root and create a php file 'index.php' 
     under that folder for front end controller
     How:   shell> touch /var/www/htdocs/user/index.php 
     For security purpose: shell> chmod 640 /var/www/htdocs/user/index.php
       
 - under document_root, create a file 'index'php' as home page 
   How:  shell> touch  /var/www/htdocs/index.php 
   For accessibility purpose: shell> chmod 755 /var/www/htdocs/index.php
            
Here is the list of files:
/var/www/htdocs/index.php 
/var/www/htdocs/dispatcher.php 
/var/www/htdocs/addUsers.php 
/var/www/htdocs/users_schema.s ql
/var/www/htdocs/RESTFul.php
/var/www/htdocs/user/index.php
/var/www/htdocs/user/ userController.php
/var/www/htdocs/user/usersDB. php
